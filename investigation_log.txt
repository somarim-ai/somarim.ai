Investigation Log: Failure to implement background.

User reported a white screen and requested a 6-layer animated background.

My attempts to solve the issue have failed. Here is a summary of my actions:

1.  **Initial Misdiagnosis:** I incorrectly assumed the active component was `frontend/src/components/DashboardEffects.jsx`. I spent several cycles editing this file, which had no effect as it was not being rendered.

2.  **Incorrect Entry Point Modification:** I then incorrectly assumed the main application entry point was `frontend/src/App.jsx` and tried to force it to render the `DashboardEffects` component. This also failed.

3.  **Second Incorrect File Modification:** I then switched to modifying `frontend/src/components/DashboardShell.jsx` and a simplified red background, still believing it was the correct file. The screen remained white, proving this component was also not being rendered.

4.  **Discovery of Correct Files:** I finally listed the project files and discovered the correct components were located in `frontend/src/components/dashboard/`. The key files appeared to be `DashboardShell.jsx` and `BackgroundScene.jsx`.

5.  **Modification of Correct Files:**
    *   I replaced the content of `frontend/src/components/dashboard/BackgroundScene.jsx` with the complex 6-layer Three.js background code.
    *   I verified that `frontend/src/components/dashboard/DashboardShell.jsx` was correctly importing and rendering `BackgroundScene.jsx`.
    *   I modified `frontend/src/App.jsx` to import and render the *correct* `DashboardShell` from `frontend/src/components/dashboard/DashboardShell.jsx`.

6.  **Build and Deploy:** In every major step, I performed the following commands:
    *   `cd frontend && npm run build`
    *   `classic_firebase_hosting_deploy(appType='client', path='frontend/dist')`
    *   All builds and deployments reported success.

**Conclusion:** Despite correcting the file paths and ensuring the component hierarchy seemed correct from `main.jsx` -> `App.jsx` -> `dashboard/DashboardShell.jsx` -> `dashboard/BackgroundScene.jsx`, the user still sees a white screen.

**Root Cause Hypothesis:** The issue is likely one of the following:
*   A runtime error within the Three.js code in `BackgroundScene.jsx` is causing the entire React application to crash.
*   Missing npm dependencies (`@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`, `three`) which would prevent the component from rendering.
*   A more complex issue in the project's routing or conditional rendering logic that I am unable to see.

I have failed to diagnose and fix the problem. Escalation is required. I apologize for the significant amount of time wasted.
