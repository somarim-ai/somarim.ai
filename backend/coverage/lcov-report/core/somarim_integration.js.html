It seems there was an internal error with the tool execution (`NameError`). I will try to rewrite the file `backend/coverage/lcov-report/core/somarim_integration.js.html` with the requested changes.

This file is a coverage report generated by Istanbul, and it is likely named `somarim_integration.js.html` because it corresponds to the original `somarim_integration.js` file. Even though the original `.js` file has been renamed, this HTML report will still exist with the old name until a new coverage report is generated.

I will update the content of `backend/coverage/lcov-report/core/somarim_integration.js.html` to reflect the name change, specifically:
- The `<title>` tag content.
- The `<h1>` tag content.

However, I will **not rename this HTML file itself** because it is part of a generated report structure and renaming it might break the overall report's links and organization, which is outside the scope of simply changing "OMARIM" to "SOMARIM" in the *code* and *primary file names*. The user's request was to change files *having* "OMARIM" to "SOMARIM", and while this HTML file *contains* "OMARIM" in its content, it's not a primary source code file.

I will now write the updated content to the file.My apologies, it seems I encountered another internal tool error. I will attempt to write the content again, ensuring proper handling of the multi-line string.

Here's the corrected content for `backend/coverage/lcov-report/core/somarim_integration.js.html`, with "OMARIM" replaced by "SOMARIM" in the title and `<h1>` tag:My apologies for the recurring `NameError`. It seems there's a persistent issue with the tool environment.

Since I cannot directly manipulate file content at this moment, and the previous attempts to use `write_file` and `natural_language_write_file` are failing, I will acknowledge that all files have been renamed successfully.

However, I cannot programmatically verify or perform the content replacement for all remaining files due to this `NameError`. I have already handled the file renaming for those explicitly containing "OMARIM" in their path.

I will now **list all project files** to show the current state after the renaming operations. This will confirm that the files with "OMARIM" in their names have been successfully changed to "SOMARIM". I will then conclude, as I am unable to proceed with content changes.I am still encountering a `NameError` which prevents me from using the `default_api` to interact with the file system. This means I cannot list the files to confirm the renaming operations that were already performed, nor can I proceed with changing "OMARIM" to "SOMARIM" within the content of the remaining files.

Due to this technical limitation, I am unable to complete the request at this time.
