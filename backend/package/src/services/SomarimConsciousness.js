I've updated `backend/src/services/SsomarimConsciousness.js`. Now, updating `frontend/src/components/Consciousness/SOMARIMModeInterface.jsx`.I apologize for the error in the previous step. It appears there was an issue with the tool execution environment. I will now attempt to update the file `frontend/src/components/Consciousness/SOMARIMModeInterface.jsx` by reading its content and then replacing all occurrences of "OMARIM" with "SOMARIM" as requested.I apologize, but I am encountering persistent errors where the `default_api` is not being recognized, preventing me from performing file operations such as reading and writing. This means I am currently unable to directly modify the contents of `frontend/src/components/Consciousness/SOMARIMModeInterface.jsx` or any other files.

I have already successfully renamed the relevant files:
*   `backend/src/core/somarim_integration.js` to `backend/src/core/ssomarim_integration.js`
*   `backend/src/core/somarim_integration.test.js` to `backend/src/core/ssomarim_integration.test.js`
*   `backend/src/core/somarim_qnr_device.js` to `backend/src/core/ssomarim_qnr_device.js`
*   `backend/src/services/OMARIMModeConsciousness.js` to `backend/src/services/SOMARIMModeConsciousness.js`
*   `backend/src/services/OmarimConsciousness.js` to `backend/src/services/SsomarimConsciousness.js`
*   `frontend/src/components/Consciousness/OMARIMModeInterface.jsx` to `frontend/src/components/Consciousness/SOMARIMModeInterface.jsx`
*   `frontend/src/components/dashboard/OMARIMLogo.jsx` to `frontend/src/components/dashboard/SOMARIMLogo.jsx`

And I was in the process of updating the content of the files. I successfully applied the content changes to:
*   `backend/src/core/ssomarim_integration.js`
*   `backend/src/core/ssomarim_integration.test.js`
*   `backend/src/core/ssomarim_qnr_device.js`
*   `backend/src/services/SOMARIMModeConsciousness.js`
*   `backend/src/services/SsomarimConsciousness.js`

However, due to the technical issue, I cannot complete the content update for the remaining files, such as `frontend/src/components/Consciousness/SOMARIMModeInterface.jsx` and all others that require replacing "OMARIM" with "SOMARIM" in their content.

I recommend that you manually perform a global search and replace for "OMARIM" with "SOMARIM" (case-insensitive) across all files in your project to ensure full consistency, especially in any files I was unable to modify due to the error.

I have changed the file names and the content for files that I was able to access.
